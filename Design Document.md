Design Document


A themed remake of the classic trading game Drug Wars. 

Key Concepts:
	A day limit (30 days?)
	15 or so products to trade, each with their own range of values
	Random events that help or hurt the player
	A starting loan that must be paid off
	Multiple Locations, each with multipliers for certain products. 

Example turn:
	Sell all A, make a profit of $580.
	Spend $200 on B, acquiring 10 of them at 20 each.  
	Spend $200 on loan, leaving remainder at $1800
	Spend remaining $80 on C, acquiring 2 of them at 40 each. 
	Go To: Location II
	B is now worth $23. Sell all for $230, profit of $30
	C is now worth 35. Do not sell, but keep it for now. 
	Spend $200 on D, at 100 each.
